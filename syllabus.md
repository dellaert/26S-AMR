## Syllabus

### Description
Mobile robots—ground vehicles, legged robots, underwater vehicles, drones, and space robots—are increasingly prevalent across diverse domains.  This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical foundations of robot mobility, emphasizing optimization, estimation, and control.  Students will also gain hands-on experience with multiple types of mobile robots.

## Course Goals and Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion, you will be able to:

- Derive kinematic and dynamic models of common mobile robots  
- Interpret mathematical models of range, vision, and inertial sensors  
- Design SLAM algorithms for various sensor modalities  
- Implement real-time navigation algorithms for different mobile robots  
- Apply and develop these methods in your own research  

### Prerequisites
For undergrads:
- **CS 3630**: Introduction to Robotics Perception

For everyone:
- Linear algebra
- Multivariate Calculus

The course requires access to a computer that can run Webots. A GPU card will make things faster and easier but a workaround might be available.  All programming assignments will be completed in Python.

### Grading
- **25%** Quizzes  
- **75%** Labs  

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation of the Honor Code. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct, available [here](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-life/academic-honor-code). 

You are expected to implement the core components of each project on your own, but the extra credit opportunities often build on third party data sets or code. That's fine. Feel free to include results built on other software, as long as you are clear in your hand-in that it is not your own work.

You should not view or edit anyone else's code. You should not post code to Piazza, except for starter code / helper code that isn't related to the core project.

### Use of GenAI

I ask you to be present for the assignments, thoroughly understand them, and take full ownership of the artifacts you produce. Coding with AI is now a fact of life, and it's great, thrilling even! I encourage the use of tools like co-pilot and cursor to help you code. 

However, the use of generative AI to code up an entire assignment with  minimal involvement from your part (e.g., pasting the entire assignment in to an AI, or using "Agentic" AI to take care of the whole project) defeats the point of the class. Hence, this **falls under the academic dishonesty policy**. The purpose of the assignment is to build intuition and skill in robotics, which cannot be outsourced. Hence, I expect you to *personally* embark on each TODO in the coding assignments, being fully engaged. This includes using AI tools as you go along, but *not* to substitute your own understanding. 

The assignments will frequently be accompanied with reflection questions designed to help assess whether you have fully grokked the methods/algorithms/techniques the assignments are designed to help you learn. I expect that you to be the author of the answers, not the prompter.

### Learning Accommodations
If needed, we will make classroom accommodations for students with documented disabilities. These accommodations must be arranged in advance and in accordance with the [ADAPTS office](www.adapts.gatech.edu).

### Piazza

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

### Contact Info and Office Hours:
Use Piazza to ask questions and seek clarifications. If you have a very specific question (related to your grade etc.) or a question that involves your personal information, you can make a private post on Piazza.

The TA office hours will be announced very soon, along with the location, in a pinned post on Piazza. 

### Acknowledgements
The materials from this class might rely on slides prepared by other instructors. Each slide set and assignment contains acknowledgements. Feel free to use these slides for academic or research purposes, but please maintain all acknowledgements.
